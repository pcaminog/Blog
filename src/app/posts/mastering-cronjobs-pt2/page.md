# Implementing Cron Jobs Within Scripts: Python, PHP, Rails, Node.js, and Go

In the first part of our series, we covered how to set up scheduled tasks on different operating systems. Now, let's delve into how to implement cron job functionality directly within scripts using popular programming languages like Python, PHP, Rails, Node.js, and Go. 

## Python: Scheduling with `schedule`

Python doesn't have a built-in cron module, but you can use third-party libraries like `schedule` to mimic cron-like functionality. Here's how to set up a simple scheduled task in Python:

### Step 1: Install `schedule`
```bash
pip install schedule
```

### Step 2: Write your python script
```python
import schedule
import time

def job():
    print("Performing a scheduled task in Python")

schedule.every(10).minutes.do(job)

while True:
    schedule.run_pending()
    time.sleep(1)
```

-	This script sets up a task that runs every 10 minutes.
-	Replace job function with your desired task.

### Step 3: Run Your Script

-	Execute your Python script as usual. The scheduler will handle the task execution.

schedule is a simple and user-friendly way to implement in-script task scheduling in Python.

This part covers Python, and upcoming sections will guide you through setting up similar tasks in PHP, Rails, Node.js, and Go. Stay tuned to learn more about in-script cron job scheduling in these languages.
